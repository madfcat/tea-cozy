# ðŸ¤¸ Codecademy Responsive Design Flex Box: Tea Cozy Project

The off-platform project from _Codecademy_ course to test my _Flex Box_ skills in responsive web design.
I tried to flex as much as I could.

## Features
* Fully responsive layout
* Sticky header
* Responsive viewport units (vw, vmin)
* **Flex Box**

## Little tip

I use this little CSS code to check if all the elements have the right size. It's easy to comment and uncomment if needed. 

```
* {
    border: 1px solid white;
}
```
